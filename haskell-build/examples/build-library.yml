      Building a library often requires building and testing it with multiple versions of GHC.
      It also does not require producing binaries, so in this example we disable writing a workspace.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    haskell: haskell-works/haskell-build@1.6.6 # use latest version

  workflows:
    build-my-library:
      jobs:
        - haskell/build:
            name: GHC 8.4.4
            executor: haskell/ghc-8_4_4

        - haskell/build:
            name: GHC 8.6.3
            executor: haskell/ghc-8_6_3
